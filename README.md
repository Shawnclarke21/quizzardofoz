quiz for javascript

## purpose
 the purpose of this project is to be able to show the skills that i have acquired through the past week and put it into practice to build a coding quiz
 the quiz is also a way to test my knowledge of coding through a quiz


## what does it do

when finished with this the project will display a start screen and when clicked it will bring you to the page where you can read the rules of the quiz and once you hit continue then the quiz will begin when starting you have a set time to answer and for every question you get wrong points get taken off final results at the end.

## challanges

some of the challanges ive faced throughout this challange so far has been getting my css and box styling to work properly and the way i want so far another challange i know i will face when the time comes is going to be setting up the javascript and figuring out where to start when it comes to these projects recently javascript has definitly been a change and it hit hard.
